/// Packet header for the [Real-time Transport Protocol].

/// A description of fields:

/// ## `version`
/// RTP version. Should be `2`.

/// ## `padding`
/// Packet contains padding octets which are not part of the payload.
/// The last byte of the payload contains the
/// count of bytes to be ignored from the end (including itself).
///
/// ## `extension`
/// If set, the fixed header must be followed by exactly one [`RtpExtension`].
///
/// ## `csrc_count`
/// Number of CSRC identifiers following the fixed header.

/// ## `marker`
/// Bitflag with application/profile-specific meaning, *e.g.*, frame boundaries.

/// ## `sequence`
/// Increments by `1` for every packet sent, and used to detect packet loss
/// or enable reordering.

/// Should be initialised to a random number.

/// ## `timestamp`
/// Sampling instant for the first octet of the payload: must be derived from a
/// monotonically and linearly increasing clock. If data are generated periodically,

/// one for every sampling period).

/// Synchronisation Source, identifying the sender.

/// Should be initialised to a random number.
